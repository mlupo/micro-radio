A microcontroller radio project using the Adafruit PyBadge

Using the [Adafruit Pybadge](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200) along with an [Adalogger FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2922), the PyBadge plays a song from an sdcard with a simple button press.

I very much wanted to create a small radio for my 2yo son, so that he could play some tunes without having to use some kind of smart device. This is very much inspired by the [Yoto Mini](https://ca.yotoplay.com/yoto-mini), but I was interested in creating something a bit simpler, and could play wav files directly.

## The Progress So Far
The code in main.py and badgey.py work together to play the listed files from the /sd directory, and it all more or less works as planned! But, more refinements are needed to the 3D printed case. Just a bit more work to do (and document)!
